File Organizer (FileNest)

A small desktop app to automatically sort files by type within a chosen folder.
It creates subfolders (Images, PDFs, Videos, etc.), moves files by extension, avoids name conflicts by renaming duplicates, and shows real-time progress and logs.
Includes a welcome help screen and an About window with a Ko-fi link.

Features

Sorts files by extension into subfolders (and an “Others” category).

Simulation mode: previews actions without moving files.

Recursive mode: includes subfolders.

Real-time progress bar and activity log.

Skips already sorted files and handles duplicates safely: file (1).ext.

Requirements

Windows 10/11

Python 3.10+ (standard library only)
